# Project features :

Some features of the project are :

- **Simplicity:** This project is done by vite react which is known for its simplicity and ease of use
- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM which is an exact copy of the real DOM. It makes the app so much faster.
- **Components:** The key feature of React is the composition of components. It allows us to break down the UI into individual pieces. This makes the UI more manageable and easier to understand.

# How I managed the state in The assignment project:

* In my assignment project, I managed the state using the useState and useEffect hooks provided by React.
* The useState hook was used to create state variables in my functional components. This hook returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
* The useEffect hook was used to perform side effects in my components. These side effects were operations that I needed to perform outside of the normal render cycle, such as fetching data from the json.
